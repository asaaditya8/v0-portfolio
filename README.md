# Portfolio v0
Highly experimental design & code.

## Objectives
1. To implement components by hand in order to grab an understanding.
2. To test the concept of making a webpage as scroll-free as it can be.
3. To develop design skills, which were infinitesimally small.

## Why scroll-free
It just felt to me that scrolling is not needed in the timeline kind of views if new items drop from the top.

### Trigger for new items
This is subject to research. It has not been explored much.

### Threads
This is also subject to research.
#### Approaches
- [x] Links and Nav bar
- [ ] Slides

## ðŸ›  Installation & Set Up

1. Install the dependencies
    ```sh

   npm run dev
   ```

## :rocket: Building and Running for Production

1. Generate a full static production build

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

1. Preview the site as it will appear once deployed

   ```sh
   npm run serve
   ```
